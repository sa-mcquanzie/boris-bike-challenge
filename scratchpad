4. Errors are good

- We got the 'unitialized constant' error. 
- We followed the stack trace and indentified the line that the error was occurring on - line 1 of irb.
- We had a good understanding of what the error was from existing knowledge. We skimmed Ruby Documentation to confirm this.
- We solved the error by creating the missing class hence we were able to initialise a new instance of this class.

5. From Feature Tests to Unit Tests

- We set up rspec using 'rspec --init'
- We added a docking_station file in the lib folder, and a test for it in the spec folder
- We added a describe block to the docking_station spec to test for the existence of a Docking Station class
- We ran rspec and recieved an error
- We found the error was describing the same problem as the last error: Uninitialized constant, but was more informative in its description
