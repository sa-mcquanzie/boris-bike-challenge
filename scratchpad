4. Errors are good

- We got the 'unitialized constant' error. 
- We followed the stack trace and indentified the line that the error was occurring on - line 1 of irb.
- We had a good understanding of what the error was from existing knowledge. We skimmed Ruby Documentation to confirm this.
- We solved the error by creating the missing class hence we were able to initialise a new instance of this class.

5. From Feature Tests to Unit Tests

- We set up rspec using 'rspec --init'
- We added a docking_station file in the lib folder, and a test for it in the spec folder
- We added a describe block to the docking_station spec to test for the existence of a Docking Station class
- We ran rspec and recieved an error
- We found the error was describing the same problem as the last error: Uninitialized constant, but was more informative in its description

6. Passing Your First Unit Tests

- We created the lib directory and created a docking_station.rb file
- We Defined DockingStation class inside docking_station.rb
- We required 'DockingStation' in the spec file
- We ran rspec and found that it passed!

7. Back to the Feature

- We started irb and required our docking_station.rb file containing the DockingStation class
- We created a new DockingStation instance in irb and called it docking_station
- This was successful because the DockingStation class now exists and has an initialize method
- We attempted to call release_bike method on docking_station
- This failed because there is no such method defined

8. Back to the unit

- We wrote test to check if Docking Station instances respond to the release_bike method. 
We used before each in rspec to create new class instances before each test runs.
- We then converted the above test to one-line version
- Ran rspec from the command line and explained the error where we hadn't created a the relevant 
method in the docking_station class.
- To eliminate this error, we added the release_bike method to the docking_station class.
- We then ran rspec and explained why the error was eliminated. It was because we correctly added the method.
