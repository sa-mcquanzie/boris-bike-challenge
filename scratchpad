4. Errors are good

- We got the 'unitialized constant' error. 
- We followed the stack trace and indentified the line that the error was occurring on - line 1 of irb.
- We had a good understanding of what the error was from existing knowledge. We skimmed Ruby Documentation to confirm this.
- We solved the error by creating the missing class hence we were able to initialise a new instance of this class.
